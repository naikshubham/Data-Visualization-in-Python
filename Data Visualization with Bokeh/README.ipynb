    "### Data Visualization with Bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plotting with glyphs\n",
    "- Glyphs are visual shapes that can be drawn on the screen. These can be simple point-like markers such as circles, squares or triangles or more sophisticated shapes such as rectangles, lines, patches, wedges and others.\n",
    "- In every case, these shapes have visual properties that can include things like position or x & y coordinates for locating a shape on the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_file, show\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure   # figure create emply plot\n",
    "\n",
    "plot = figure(plot_width=400, tools='pan, box_zoom')\n",
    "\n",
    "plot.circle([1,2,3,4,5], [8,6,5,2,3])\n",
    "output_file('circle.html')\n",
    "show(plot)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Glyph properties\n",
    "- Lists, tuples, columns from dataframes works well. Its also possible to configure properties with a single fixed value\n",
    "- Here we have x=10, but given lists y and for size, output is all the circles are centered at x=10, but the y values and sizes vary according to the lists that we passed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plot = figure()\n",
    "plot.circle(x=10, y=[2,5,8,12], size=[10, 20, 30, 40])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional glyphs\n",
    "- In addition to glyphs such as circles or squares, Bokeh can draw many other kinds of visual shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# lines and circles together\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_file, show\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure\n",
    "\n",
    "x = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "y = [8,6,4,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "plot = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "plot.line(x, y, line_width=3)\n",
    "plot.circle(x,y,fill_color='white', size=10)\n",
    "\n",
    "output_file('line.html')\n",
    "show(plot)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Patches\n",
    "- Patches can be used to draw multiple polygonal shapes at once on a single plot. This might be useful if we want to draw geographic regions such as countries or states.\n",
    "- The input data for patches takes a slightly different form. `.patches` can draw multiple polygons by being given a list of patch coordinates. But each patch itself needs multiple coordinates.\n",
    "- For this reason, cordinate data for `.patches` is a list of lists. One list of lists is for the x-cordinates, other for y-cordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_file, show\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure\n",
    "\n",
    "xs = [[1,1,2,2],[2,2,4],[2,2,3,3]]\n",
    "ys = [[2,5,5,2],[3,5,5],[2,3,4,2]]\n",
    "\n",
    "plot = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "plot.patches(xs,ys,fill_color=['red','blue','green'],line_color='white')\n",
    "\n",
    "output_file('patches.html')\n",
    "show(plot)\n",
    "```\n",
